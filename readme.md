Mobypicture Delete
==================

Since Mobypicture has no "delete" account option and the manual deletion 
of single posts takes forever (and feels like work) you can use this script.

It's very hacky, but it works (although might take a while)

This is not because I don't like Mobypicture! I have used it for quite a while
and had a lot of fun, but I wanted my old photos of the internet.

Usage
-----

First authenticate in your browser with Mobypicture and fetch the cookie,
put the value in the `cookie` var you find at the top of `index.js`. 

Then just run:
```
yarn
node index.js
```
